### **Welcome to OpenPM Foundry!**

OpenPM Foundry is a GitHub organization dedicated to promoting open-source initiatives. Our primary focus is creating The OpenPM Playbook, a comprehensive guide designed to help zero-to-one-stage organizations set up effective project management processes. Our goal is to create a community-driven resource that supports tech departments in achieving their goals efficiently. In the future, we plan to develop open-source tools that can be used as internal solutions for these organizations.

### What is The OpenPM Playbook?

The OpenPM Playbook is a step-by-step guide that outlines best practices and tools for managing projects in early-stage tech companies. It will cover topics such as project planning, team collaboration, and open-source tools for project management.
